# Front-end Applicant Assignments

The purpose of this repository is to create the basis that you as an applicant to a job at DR can complete in order to showcase your abilities as a software developer.

All assignments should not take more than a few hours to complete, but feel free to spend as much time as you feel is necessary to showcase your talents. *Also remember that this is not mandatory. If you've got some other code you would rather show us then simply send us a link to that instead.*

## The Assignments

There are a total of 6 different types of assignments. Each assignment gives a number of points based on its level of difficulty. You choose which ones to solve, the more the better. All of them? Great. You get 10 points for each assignment just for trying - even though you didn't solve it correctly!
