The TV department wants a prototype of how shows that are expiring soon can be presented.

The API endpoint documentation can be found here:
	http://www.dr.dk/mu-online/Help/1.0/Api/GET-api-apiVersion-list-view-lastchance_limit_offset

**Assignment:** Create a simple single page application reading the API endpoint above using only front-end technologies. 

There are many ways to solve this assignment, but the following guidelines would be advantageous:

* Use a templating engine for client-side HTML rendering
* Use either jQuery or Mootools. 
* Write well-structured semantic HTML5 and use CSS3 where it makes sense
* Make the solution cross-browser compatible from IE8+.

*You're allowed to keep a static copy of the data feed in your solution to avoid cross-domain issues.*

*Assignment Files:* None, add your own.
